                <h4 class="card-title">My time with Tafe QLD</h4>
                <p class="card-text">
                    I enrolled in the Diploma of ICT with Advanced Programming at Tafe QLD in June 2022.
                    I chose this course because I wanted to learn how to develop web applications using
                    modern technologies and frameworks such as ASP.NET Core and MVC. I also wanted to improve
                    my programming skills in languages such as C#, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
                    The course consisted of 22 units, covering topics such as database design, web development,
                    software testing, project management, security and ethics.
                    <br><br>
                    As a student, I demonstrated my ability to lead the team discussions in order to framework
                    a grievance procedure within a hypothetical IT work place. I also helped explain assignment
                    tasks to my peers with comparisons to real world examples. I was always proactive and
                    diligent in completing my written and coding assessments ahead of the due date. 
                    <br><br>
                    I have a passion for learning and applying new technologies and frameworks. I have not
                    wasted a coding project, but rather used each one as an opportunity to understand the
                    curriculum and the real world context for being taught each unit. I am confident
                    that I can bring value and innovation to any ICT project or organisation.

                <h4 class="card-title">Self Taught Python</h4>
                <p class="card-text">
                    during 2020 - 2022 I began using python as a way to introduce my self programming, I had
                    done my research and found that people opinion of python was that it's syntax was easier to 
                    learn then other most other languages. 
                    <br><br>
                    I began with the youtube instruction videos that would introduce the basic data
                    types, structures and concepts behind OOP. I soon discovered FreeCodeCamp.org's channel
                    and from there, their website where i completed the scientific computing certificate 
                    for python. 
                    <br><br>
                    This certificate focused on data management, validation, sanitation and string manipulation 
                    built in console applications. There is a unit where we built a web crawler that would read
                    a web page usings a basic http client, process the html using the beautiful soup library and
                    store html in an SQLite database using dapper.
