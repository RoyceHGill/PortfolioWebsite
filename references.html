                    <p>
                        Date: 9th April 2023 <br><br>
                        To whom it may concern, <br> <br> 
                        Royce has been a student in my class within the Diploma of Information Technology (Advanced 
                        Programming) at Bracken Ridge Campus since the start of 2023. Royce is aiming to complete his 
                        course in June 2023. <br><br>
                        Royce has, to date, successfully completed studies and corresponding project work in the areas of: <br> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intermediate programming in both the .Net framework (primarily C#) and Java. </li>
                            <li> Database Design and Development, and the application of Structured Query Language.</li>
                            <li>Systems Analysis and Design.</li>
                            <li>Testing, Debugging and Deployment.</li>
                        </ul> 
                        Royce is currently working on:
                        <ul>
                            <li>More advanced programming in both the .Net framework and Java </li>
                            <li>NoSQL database development using MongoDB, and well as… </li>
                            <li>A range of compliance units including project management.</li>
                        </ul> 
                        I have noted that Royce approaches his studies with enthusiasm, dedication, integrity and a keenness to 
                        master the many and various principles and approaches associated with software development. Royce 
                        has demonstrated confidence and competence in the technical aspects of programming, as well as the 
                        analysis, design and project management aspect of the course. <br> <br>
                        I believe Royce would be an absolute asset to any firm looking for a dedicated and enthusiastic 
                        software developer. <br><br>
